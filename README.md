# Gin Rummy

This repository contains a minimal Python model of the card game Gin Rummy.

The `gin_rummy.py` script defines basic classes for cards, hands, players and the game itself. It includes a simple simulation that deals cards to two players and has them draw and discard randomly until someone goes gin or the deck runs out of cards.

Run the script with:

```bash
python3 gin_rummy.py
```

The example in `__main__` is purely demonstrative and does not implement full game strategy.
